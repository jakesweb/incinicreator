## Where creative works can generate money

---

The hope of this project is to allow users to create, manage, and host web sites that allow them to expose their talent in exchange for simple monetization.

## How Web Monetization Works

---

The platform will extensively use the web monetization standard to allow for payments. The standard utilizes micro-payments which can be used to unlock content. More about web monetization can be found at the [web monetization web page](https://webmonetization.org/).

## Stack

The project is a work in progress and as I create more documentation this page will be updated. For now the stack will be:

Vue.js
Express
MongoDB (accessed through Mongoose)
Auth0 (for authentication)
